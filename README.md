## A Quantitative Analysis of the Stocks of Different Sectors; Comparing the Ease of Prediction of One Sector from Another using Machine Learning Techniques.

### Software, Programs, Languages etc. used:
- Python
- PyCharm IDE
- Google Collab
- Microsoft Excel
- Yahoo Finance

### Machine Learning Techniques used:
- LR (Linear Regression)
- SVR (Support Vector Regression)
- ANN (Articial Neural Network)

### Evaulation Metrics used:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

### Dataset Location:
- All datasets used are in the **dataset** directory, sorted by sector name. The top 10 stocks from each sector at the time were used.

## Results Location:
- Raw results for LR and SVR are in the **results/Sectors** directory, sorted by sector name. Results for FB and AML are present in the **results** directory.
- Raw results for ANN are in the **results-ann/Sectors** directory, sorted by sector name.
- Raw sorted results for everything, as well as some manipulation of results, are in the excel workbook named **'All Results Final.xlsx'**. Each sector has its own Sheet in the workbook.
-  
The **dataset** directory contains all the datasets which were used in this project, sorted by the Sectors.
